# Biography

I am a PhD student from Scotland who is currently working for [NVision Imaging Technologies GmbH](https://www.nvision-imaging.com/) based in Ulm, Germany. During my time at NVision I've worked on several different projects, but they have all been centred around applying quantum optimal control (QOC) to a variety of different systems.

The first project that I finished involved the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, where we worked to develop spin-1 sensing sequences. During this research, I also became interested in noise modelling and noise spectroscopy, especially incorporating noise into optimization algorithms.

After this, I began working on molecular crystals, specifically pentacene doped naphthalene, where we implemented closed-loop optimal control for dynamic nuclear polarization for the first time. It lead to a factor of 3 reduction in the time taken to reach specific polarization goals. 

My most recent work has focussed on the para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) of molecules like pyruvate. We developed $B_1$ sweeps at low-fields (something that hadn't been demonstrated before, but is a common technique at high field) and then demonstrated their efficacy. Using this technique, we can effectively avoid relaxation pathways and reach polarization levels that are comparable to high-field systems.
